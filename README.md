## Decreasing Inconsistent Alarms in PACU

This repository houses the data and analysis scripts for the study on reducing inconsistent alarm notifications in a Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) at a general tertiary hospital. This pragmatic clinical trial aimed to explore the effect of a staff educational program on customizing alarm settings of bedside monitors to decrease inconsistent alarms.

### Key Outcomes
- **Publication:** The findings were published in the "Brazilian Journal of Anesthesiology", May-Jun 2024 issue, under the title "Decreasing inconsistent alarms notifications: a pragmatic clinical trial in a post-anesthesia care unit" [Braz J Anesthesiol. 2024; 74(3): 744456. Published online 2023 Aug 9. doi: 10.1016/j.bjane.2023.07.013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjane.2023.07.013).
- **Implementation:** The project's methodologies have been adopted across hospitals in the Rede D'Or network, enhancing patient safety and reducing staff alarm fatigue.

### Statistical Contributions
As the statistician on this project, I conducted all statistical analyses including hypothesis testing, descriptive and inferential statistics, effect sizes, logistic regression models for calculating odds ratios, and producing various graphical representations integral to understanding the data.

### Background
Excessive clinical alarms can lead to alarm fatigue, potentially causing healthcare professionals to miss critical alarms. This study aims to reduce these false alarms through targeted educational interventions and alarm customization based on patient-specific physiological conditions.

### Methods
- **Study Design:** Prospective, open-label, single-arm, analytic, quantitative.
- **Intervention:** An educational program focused on customizing alarm settings.
- **Data Collection:** Observations over 30 consecutive days, pre- and post-intervention.
- **Analysis Tools:** Data was analyzed using R programming, focusing on alarm consistency and the effectiveness of educational interventions.

### Results
The intervention significantly decreased the rate of inconsistent alarms from 45.2% to 9.4% by educating staff on customizing alarm settings according to patient-specific baseline values.

### Conclusion
Customizing alarm settings based on individual patient data effectively reduces inconsistent alarms, decreases alarm fatigue, and enhances patient safety in the PACU.
